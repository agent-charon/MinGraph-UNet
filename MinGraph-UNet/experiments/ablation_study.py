    # instantiate or represent the ablated model.
    # E.g., if variant_name is "Min-Cut Only", the loaded model should only use Min-Cut logic.
    # This might require modifications to evaluate_yield_model or a more general eval function.

    # For simplicity, let's assume `evaluate_yield_model` can handle a generic "model_type"
    # that corresponds to an ablated version.
    # Or, each ablation variant is treated as a distinct `model_type`.

    # Table 3 has "Count Accuracy" and "Error", so it's yield-focused.
    # The `model_type` passed to evaluate_yield_model would be the `ablation_variant_name`
    # or a mapping from it to a loadable model configuration.
    
    # This is a conceptual mapping. The `evaluate_yield_model` would need to
    # correctly instantiate the model based on `ablation_variant_name`.
    # E.g., if "Min-Cut Only", it loads a model that only does U-Net -> PatchGAT -> MinCut-Predictor -> Count.
    
    # If your `train_end_to_end.py` can be configured to train these ablated versions,
    # then `evaluate_yield_model` (with a flexible model loader) could work.
